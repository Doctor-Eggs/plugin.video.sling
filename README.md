## Important Information

* **Must** have a valid SlingTV account
* **Must** reside in the USA. VPN access is possible but not supported.
* This add-on will create a database file and cache meta-information on your device. Video content is **not** stored.
* Should database corruption occur resulting in errors, it is acceptable to delete the database file located in the userdata folder. The database will be recreated next attempt to read/write.
  * There is "Delete database" option under "Expert." This leaves the database file/structure intact and simply purges the data.
* The Slinger service is experimental and a work-in-progress, as such it also optional.
